                    Today, he closed his laptop with a sense of finality. "The Philadelphia Orchestra," he said, unprompted. "They're going to play my piece next season." His hands were shaking as he packed up his things.

                    Now there's a small plaque on his usual table: "Reserved for the Maestro."

                    It was five minutes to closing when he walked in. Normally, we'd be annoyed, but something in his demeanor made us pause. "Chamomile tea, please," he said softly. "And maybe someone to talk to?"
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
                    "Fifty years sober today," he shared, warming his hands around the cup. "My sponsor passed last year. First time I'm celebrating without him." He pulled out a gold chip from his pocket, turning it over and over.

                <p class="text-gray-300">
                    We stayed open an extra hour that night, listening to his story. Sometimes a cup of tea is more than just a cup of tea.
